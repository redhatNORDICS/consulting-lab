# This sub-part of the inventory is where we dynamically add connection information for the VM's we create.
# During VM provisioning we do a lineinfile: to ensure IP information is there.
#
# When doing an end-to-end play we rely on the add_host: functionality 
# to be able to connect to the VM after the bootstrap.
#
# But add_host adds the host to the temporary in-memory inventory.
# After the play is over, the host information is lost.
# Therefor we add them here for future connections.
# 
# _This file should be pretty handsoff and managed by the vm-create and vm-destroy roles._
#
# Statically ip's are given in the 
# vm:
#   network: mgmt
#   ip_address: 10.5.0.15
#
# But the variable we need to define is the `ansible_host:`.
