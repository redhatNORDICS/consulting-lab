Labhost VM-create
=================

Role to create VM's.  
Tightly coupled with [`libvirt_networks`](/roles/libvirt_network/) and [`vm-template`](/roles/vm-template).  
It relies on the `libvirt_networks:` for network placement and `vm-teplate` to provide a template image to _clone_ from.


Usage
=====

Once vm-template has been run and a template is available you can use this role to create copies.
```
- hosts: labhost
  roles:
  - vm-template
  - vm-create
```
