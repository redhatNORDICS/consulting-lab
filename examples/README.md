Examples
========
**WIP**

Here you find ready to use examples of how to setup your lab.
Each example is contained within a folder.
The folders contains ansible inventory and a playbook together with a vars file that describes the environment.

When you check out this repo you can modify the inventory to point to your host and run the playbook like:
```
ansible-playbook -i examples/<example>/playbook.yml -i 
```

But of course you can use the examples however you like and there shouldn't be anything that requires you to use the examples path.
